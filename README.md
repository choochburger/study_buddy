Study Buddy is a mobile friendly study app featuring tight google spreadsheets integration.

Here's a typical user flow:

* Create a spreadsheet. Questions are entered in column one, answers are entered into column two. 
* Create multiple worksheets within the spreadsheet to create different quiz categories (Category name = Worksheet name).
* Launch the app and autheticate with google.
* Choose your newly created spreadsheet.
* Quiz yourself until your eyes bleed.

Data is saved in local storage, so it's not necessary to login to google spreadsheets every time you launch the app.
